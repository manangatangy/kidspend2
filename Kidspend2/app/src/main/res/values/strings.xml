        Eskey manages a local store of encrypted data.
        \n\nThe cipher-text (ie, encrypted) data may be backed up and restored using local files.
        You may also export and import the data as clear-text (ie, as un-encrypted data).
        \n\nWhen performing file I/O operations, the user specifies whether to access
        the private storage directory or the public storage directory.
        \n\nIf you select the public storage directory, then you must grant the app storage access permission.
        This permission may be revoked (or re-granted) by editing the app settings.
        The public storage directory is normally shared (eg, as a mounted USB drive to a host computer).
        \n\nNo special permission is needed for Eskey to access the private storage directory. Note that the
        private storage directory is not shared by Android and can typically only be accessed by root (eg,
        adb/debugging technique).
